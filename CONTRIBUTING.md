# Contributing to Phinch

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Phinch :tada:! 

Phinch is an open-source app for visualizing biological data.

In 2014 we created the original [Phinch webapp](https://github.com/PitchInteractiveInc/Phinch/) to help scientists visualize biological data. Now we're brining Phinch to the desktop to enable updated formats, larger datasets, and a fresh new interface.
